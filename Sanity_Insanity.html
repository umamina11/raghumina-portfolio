      <strong> Title:</strong> <br>
      <br>

    <strong>
        Introduction to Theme / Setting
    </strong>
        A paragraph (maybe more) of flavor text and/or explanation of the game and the
        time/place/context in which it is set.<br>
        <br>
    <strong>
        Objective of the Game
    </strong>

        Give it to em’ straight. What are players trying to do to win? Is it collecting the most resources,
        earning the most Victory Points, or having the most cards in their hand? Boil it down for the
        players so they understand fundamentally what’s the main objective to the game to win. This
     should be a short description of the main objective.<br>
    <br>

    <strong>
        Components
    </strong>

        This section provides descriptions of components and materials in the box. Make sure to include
        an itemized listing of all the game components and their counts if appropriate. You may want to
        also include a short description of what they’re used for. Optional but sometimes pictures help
        too if there are lots of different bits.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>
        Setup
    </strong>

    Includes how to officially setup the game on a table. This section needs to help players set
    everything up before they begin playing. Optional but good practice is to also include a picture
    of a completed setup. Make sure to also include a set of declarative statements such as:<br>
    <div class="inside">
            ● Shuffle each deck separately<br>
            ● Deal each player five cards<br>
            ● Place the remaining cards face down in the middle of the table as a draw pile.<br>
            <br>
    </div>
    <strong>
        How To Play
    </strong>

            Give a detailed description of how to play the game giving a breakdown of the mechanics. For
            example, “The Game is played in a series of rounds. During each round, players can do x, y or
            z.” or “During the game, players take turns drawing a card and playing a card.” Optional but
            good practice is to include an Example Turn (with illustrations) for players to understand what a
            full turn may look like. This section may also include strategy tips or clarifications.
<!---sub section in rule book-->
    <div class="inside">
        <b>
            Start of a Turn or Round
        </b>
        <br>
            In games with rounds, you may wish to describe tasks that are necessary at the start of
            each round.
            <br>
        <b>
            Player Actions During a Turn or Round
        </b>
        <br>
            If players have some choice of actions, set out what those actions mean. Give each
            action its own paragraph.
            <br>
        <b>
          
            End of a Turn or Round
        </b>
        <br>
            What happens at the end of a turn or round? Which direction does play continue?
        <br>
        

    </div>
    <br>
        <b>
        End of a Turn or Round
        </b>
        <br>
        What triggers the game’s end? What are the winning conditions of the game? Include tie breaker
        rules.<br>
        <br>

<p>
    <b> Introduction to Theme/ Setting</b><br>
    <i>
        Sanity Insanity is a Game for Change. It’s goal is to promote a positive attitude and encourage
        supporting each other through challenging situations. The main theme is the effect of life events
        and how taxing it can be on our mental health. Our aim is to spread mental health awareness
        and explore ways of staying sane.
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>
            Pitch for players
            <br>
  
         </b>
         Life can be mentally draining. With everyday stress piling up, it gets harder and harder to
maintain your sanity. Will you be able to finish the game sane and sound?<br>

    </i>
    <br>
    <b>
        Objective of the Game
<br>
    </b>
    <i>
        Player who has the most sanity points at the end of the game wins.<br>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Components</b><br>
    <div class="secondinside">
    <b>    1. Life Events Cards (54 cards)<br></b>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Life Events cards represent life events that have a positive or negative mental health
impact. The board has three life stages: Childhood, Adulthood, and Elderly. Each life
event carries positive or negative sanity points, depending on their mental health impact
and is used during the Adulthood stage.<br>  <br>
<b>2. Personal Traits Cards (18 cards)<br>
    </b>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Traits cards represent personal traits that affect our reactions to life events. In
the game, traits enhance or mitigate mental health impact by increasing or decreasing
sanity points toll of life events. The cards can be used during the game, otherwise they
will affect end balance based on their specified value.<br>  <br>
<b>
3. Friendship Coins (1 of each color, 6 total)<br></b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If two players are friends, the sanity points gained or lost are being modified and both
friends are affected.<br>  <br>
<b>
4. Gameboard<br>  <br>

5. 6 Colored Tiles and a Die<br>  <br>
6. Point Tracker<br></b>  <br>

    </div>
<b>
    Setup<br>

</b>
<div class="secondinside">
    ● Each player chooses a colored tile<br>
● At the beginning, each player has a balance of 50 mental health points<br>
● Each player takes 3 trait cards at random (Player who will play last turn shuffle and give
3 trait cards to each player)<br>
● Each player rolls a die (Players can decide who will start first)<br>
</div>  <br>
<b>
    How to play<br></b>
    The player who rolled the highest value takes the first turn. Play then continues clockwise.
During the game, players can start or end friendships. Each player can have only one (best)
friend at the time.<br>  <br>
<div class="thirdinside">
    <b>Start of a Turn or Round</b><br>
    On your turn, roll a die. Then move your tile the number of spaces rolled.
<br>
<br>

<b>
    Player Actions During a Turn or Round<br>

</b>
Follow the instructions written on the space you land on<br>
<div class="fourth ">
    ● If you share the space with another player, you can become friends (i.e. exchange
    your friendship coins) if you both choose to. Each token is worth 5 sanity points.
    However, if you are about to start a new friendship, you need to break the one you
    already have. In this case, your existing friend loses 10 sanity points.<br>
    ● Follow any other instructions (e.g. move back or forth on a specified number of
    spaces, roll a die again, skip your next turn, move to a specific space etc.)<br>
    ● If your instruction says so, draw a Life Event card at random. The card describes
    the event and its impact on your sanity balance.<br>
    ● Bonus Way to Play:<br>
    ● (If you have a friend,<br>
    <div class=" fifth ">
        ○ The negative impact decreases two times and spreads between you and
your friend in 2:1 proportion. Alternatively, your friend can break out with
you at this point, in which case they will not be able to start any new
friendship during this game<br>
○ Both you and your friend get extra 25% of positive sanity points impact<br>

    </div>
    ● After your Life Event card has been drawn, you may choose to apply your
personal trait card to change the impact on your sanity balance)<br>

</div>

<b>End of a Turn or Round<br>
</b>
Sanity balances of everybody involved are adjusted and friendships are started or broken.
<br>  <br>
</div>
<b>
    Sudden Death<br>   <br>
</b>
The players with 0 sanity points enter Sudden Death. They must roll a four or higher to survive.
The player gets 10 sanity bonus points for surviving sudden death. Friends of that player can also
donate 5-10 points to that player to save them from Sudden Death. If they fail, they leave the
game (they “go nuts”) and go to their next life (go back to the start). Friendship tokens can carry
on to the next life (as soulmates).<br>
<br>
<b>Midlife Crisis</b><br>  <br>
Everyone must land on this tile. You can not pass this space. If you roll an odd number, you lose
-10 points. Otherwise you can proceed.<br>
<br>
<b>End of the Game</b><br>  <br>
The game is over when any of the players reaches the Finish space. This player gets 10 sanity
bonus points for being first to finish. The winner of the game is the player with the most points!
