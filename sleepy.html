            Sleep Hygiene team, some thoughts from Carolyn about designing for your target
            population:<br>
            Older adults (and especially people with MCI) like bigger screen, larger font size, and
            buttons that make intuitive sense. It’s hard for them to learn new ways to navigate
            technology – which is why transitioning them from Mac to PC or vice versa in later life is
            usually a disaster.<br>

</div>
(Jess)<br>
<div class="inside">
● Adaptive mechanics<br>
<div class="second">
○ If watch can detect that someone is having trouble falling asleep, faintly play
soothing sounds/white noise<br>
● Watch becomes a virtual companion, asking the user to do certain activities to foster its
growth, when in reality, the companion’s needs actually reflect the users’ physical/mental
needs<br>
</div>
<div class="second">
○ I.e. needs some excitement! Needs player to go out on a run to increase their heart
rate for 30 minutes within the next 2 hours<br>
○ I.e. feeling oddly hyper today… needs player to skip the daily caffeine run<br>
○ I.e. feeling restless before bed → needs player to take some time to do some
breathing exercises before bed<br>
○ I.e. feeling hungry in the morning → needs player to wake up on time to feed their
companion and also themselves<br>
○ How do we make sure that the players actually do 1/2 of these things? No clue :<<br>
</div>
<div class="third">
■ Honor system maybe?<br>
</div>
● No thoughts, brain empty<br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<div class="inside">
● The sleep gacha game wait no thats stressful<br>
<div class="second">
○ Sleep score unlock different creatures<br>
○ Better the sleep score more cooler creatures<br>
○ Each creature represents a good sleep hygiene habit<br>
○ Interact w/ each creature and learn from them<br>
○ Ex: pokemon smile<br>
<div class="third">
■ Gives reminders and take pictures<br>
</div>
○ Write notes and take pictures of what you did<br>
○ And when you interact with the environment and animals<br>
○<br>
</div>
● Some game using breathing patterns and body movements using echolocation<br>
● Sleepy game design<br>
<div class="second">
○ Go to sleep and check on your fairy farm in the morning<br>
</div>
● Sleep score generates a music score<br>
<div class=" second">
○ Music or sound ambience custom made to help you sleep<br>
○ We can incorporate some memory exercise or reminders somehow to help with the
mild cognitive impairment<br>
○ Or it could generate an image or art<br>
○ Ex: a beautiful portrait of someone doing yoga<br>
○ To give them the urge to go exercise and breathe<br>
</div>
● Jamais vu is the experience of being unfamiliar with a person or situation that is very
familiar. Opposite of Deja Vu. not a game idea but maybe a cool title suggestion<br>
● Feedback game based on personal input and input data<br>
<div class="second">
○ Survey<br>
○ Gives customized feedback<br>
○ Why am i thinking about baymax from big hero 6<br>
</div>
● Sensory game<br>
<div class="second">
○ Bop it but with a soft fluffy pillow or teddy bear<br>
○ Wait a min this is just eddie’s CPR dog game<br>
○ BUT relaxing WE MAKE IT RELAXING<br>
○ With soothing sounds<br>
○ And strong cues of relaxation<br>
</div>
</div>
Goal is to improve sleep hygiene and cognitive impairment<br>
<br>
<br>
Sleep simulation:<br>
<div class="inside">
1. Player input the basic information(age, gender, the necessary working time)<br>
2. According to the basic info, make a plan for a specific user(a get up time, go to bed time,
“you have to eat an apple now!”, “drink time!”,“Run!Piggy, run!” , as a daily missions list).<br>
3. Choose a object to raise(pet, plan, or a deserted planet)<br>
4. Good sleep data can bring benefits to the object.<br>
5. Social network: user can make friends with the other users to supervise each other(make a
bet for go to bed on time, or who is sleeping earlier )<br>
6. Reward Mechanism: Users who activate the sleep mode on time, can get a random white
noise(or any other things, a little story) from the other users; Users who failed the aim must
upload a sound.<br>
</div>
<br>
Sleep Score:
<br>
<div class="inside">
1. Like some quiz games<br>
2. Players answer some sleeping healthy questions and get some score<br>
3. There are several theme levels, each theme has 5 small levels.<br>
4. Players should get enough score to get to the next level.<br>
5. To make this game more interesting, we can add some fun animation to the question.<br>
</div>
<br>
Let me sleep ()<br>
<div class="inside">
1. Basic interface will be like health apps.<br>
2. Will consist of awards, achivements, can compare your data with other players, ranking
system.<br>
3. Task will be: maintain sleep routine, sleep quality will be checked by existing health apps.<br> 
4. Have to disconnect device from wifi or any other internet connection.<br>
5. Can play with other players, challenge them for sleep score, sleep time<br>
6. Have stages like 1. Noob sleeper, Good sleeper, Legendary sleeper etc.<br>
7. Can play sound track which are known for helping children and adults sleep.<br>
8. You can add your physician in the game.<br>
9. Share your sleep related queries with experts, FaQ’s.<br>
10. Primarily it will be a multiplayer game so other can help each other, track each other<br>
11. Can read you boring audio books.<br>
12. Get your routine checked by experts and follow them, if not able to follow them loose
points, achievements.<br>
13. Player can play a short sleep simulation game, so that he can keep remembering his goals.<br>

<br>
Try to fall asleep at the same time and wake up at the same time every day, including weekends and
long vacations.<br>
<br>
2, create an ideal sleeping environment<br>
<br>
Create a dark and quiet environment, close the curtains, put on the eye mask, and the temperature
and humidity in the room should be appropriate.<br>
<br>
3, do not bring the phone to bed<br>
<br>
Make it a good habit to do just one thing in bed – sleep (and hehehehe).
<br>
<br>
4. Pay attention to diet before going to bed<br>
<br>
Try not to eat 3 hours before going to bed, and don't drink coffee or alcoholic drinks near bedtime.<br>

    Core Game Loop Description <br>
</h3>
<p>
    The core of Dreamy World revolves around taking care of Dreamy while doing tasks that
encourage their sleep hygiene and health.<br>
<br>
Dreamy is extremely sensitive to sleep - it dramatically affects his mood, makes him forgetful,
and more. Your goal is to arrange Dreamy’s world and routines so that he sleep well. Dreamy
will show the user small activities that they can do on waking and on sleep to improve their own
quality of dreaming.<br>
<br>
Bioinformatics sent from the smart watch help inform what tasks Dreamy focuses on and
feedback given back to the player.
<br>
<br>
Each day, the player will take Dreamy with them, waking them up, transporting them on their
watch, and putting them back to bed. On waking up, Dreamy will have a mood corresponding to
the user’s sleep score, and has several tasks they can do. The player can always force Dreamy
out the door immediately, but this will make Dreamy frustrated during the day. The player can do
things like open curtains (get natural light), drink water (start metabolism and rehydrate after
rest), and the like.<br>
<br>
If Dreamy is angry after leaving the room, the player may get feedback from Dreamy indicating
missed tasks in the morning - such as a thirsty symbol or a light thought cloud.
Dreamy will mimic (and measure) user activity through the day - walks, metabolism changes,
and so on. This data will be used to understand impacts to sleep scores and provide better
recommendations.<br>
<br>
At night, the user will check Dreamy back into its room. At this point, the user can tell Dreamy to
go to bed immediately (as before) or do things to improve their sleep quality. Turning off lights,
setting an alarm, putting out a glass of water are all things that improve Dreamy’s sleep. What’s
more, where possible, these activities are mapped to the device: for example, to put Dreamy’s
phone away, the user must plug their phone into their charger to note it is being put away.

Playtest Notes 3/2/22
</p>
<div class="inside">
    ● Great start, for physical and digital for a week<br>
● Routine might be an issue<br>
● Might be better to have more Scaffolding<br>
● Have Dreamy do it alongside you rather than be open ended<br>
<div class="second">
○ Leaving it open might not be enough<br>
</div>
● Guide them through that morning routine + tie it to the real world<br>
<div class="second">
○ Ex: Dreamy goes to brush their teeth and you have to brush your teeth in order to
complete that task<br>
</div>
● Might be better to have a checklist and an order to complete the tasks<br>
● The character is cute and it feels casual enough and has minimal feedback and touch
which is good because we can’t have too much stuff to overwhelm the players<br>
● Very good for our target audience<br>
● Conceptualize both the NFCs tag and the just the phone<br>
<div class="second">
○ See if you want to make it accessible to everyone<br>
○ Not everyone can have access to the stickers<br>
</div>
● Think about how we want to prompt users and remind them how to use it<br>
● How can the app tell if they are doing that task at the moment?<br>
<div class="second">
○ Force timer?<br>
○ Or running animation<br>
</div>
● Tell Dreamy to brush teeth and he keeps doing it<br>
<div class="second">
○ Looking at him remind you to do it<br>
○ He keep going until you stop him<br>
</div>
● Add more sleep hygiene activities during the day<br>
● The feedback stuff about 30 min walk is great<br>
● We just have to flesh it out more and flesh out that screen and what we want it to look
like<br>
● For the whole list of good sleep hygiene activities ask ? one of the stakeholders name
whos i forgot<br>
● If it isn't imperative to them in the immediate need or desire. Then they won't do it<br>
